    '''
    This function assumes that a runfile has been generated with two entities.
    The first entity must be "alignment" and the second must be "pattern".
    "align_layers" is a list of layer numbers where alignment marks can be found.
    "expose_layers" is a list of layer numbers you want to expose
    "mag" is magnification. Set this somewhat lower than MaxMag (allows for rotation correction) 900 is good for 200x200 um alignment marks
    "dose" is the exposure area dose (ÂµC/cm^2) 320 is default for PMMA bilayer
    "config_param" is the configuration parameter. At CNF, this controls the SEM aperture size (important!). Can be set at the tool
    "current" is the measured beam current (pA) - this can always be set directly at the Nabity and the dwell time will update correctly

    Some customization for CNF's Nabity:
    MAG_SCALE (global variable) defined as 300000
    Square exposure grid
    Line spacing set to minimum recommended by Nabity for the finest features
