    '''
    This function assumes that a runfile has been generated with two entities.
    The first entity must be "alignment" and the second must be "pattern".
    "align_layers" is a list of layer numbers where alignment marks can be found.
    "expose_layers" is a list of layer numbers you want to expose
    "mag" is magnification. Set this somewhat lower than MaxMag (allows for rotation correction)
    "config_param" is the configuration parameter. At CNF, this controls the SEM aperture size (important!)
    "current" is the measured beam current (pA)
    "dose" is the exposure area dose (ÂµC/cm^2)

    Some customization for CNF's Nabity:
    MAG_SCALE (global variable) defined as 300000
    Square exposure grid
    Line spacing set to minimum recommended by Nabity for the finest features
